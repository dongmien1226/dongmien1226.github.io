Youâ€™ve been asked to exploit all the vulnerabilities present.

Welcome, brave cyber warriors, to the Avenger Training Cyber Security Capture the Flag! Prepare yourselves for a wild and wacky adventure through the treacherous realm of cyberspace.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and trust us, you want to), is to outsmart the devious cyber villains, snatch their flags, and assert your dominance as the reigning champions of cyber security. But be warned, the villains won't make it easy for you! 

You'll need more than just technical expertise to triumph in this whimsical battle. Think outside the box, unleash your inner prankster, and find unconventional solutions to outwit your opponents. Remember, even the most formidable challenges can be conquered with a healthy dose of laughter and an ingenious trick up your sleeve.

Just a final reminder that AV is enabled, and everything should be patched!
