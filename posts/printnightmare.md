PrintNightmare, thrice!

The nightmare continues.. Search the artifacts on the endpoint, again, to determine if the employee used any of the Windows Printer Spooler vulnerabilities to elevate their privileges. 

Scenario: After discovering the PrintNightmare attack the security team pushed an emergency patch to all the endpoints. The PrintNightmare exploit used previously no longer works. All is well. Unfortunately, the same 2 employees discovered yet another exploit that can possibly work on a fully patched endpoint to elevate their privileges.

Task: Inspect the artifacts on the endpoint to detect the PrintNightmare exploit used.
