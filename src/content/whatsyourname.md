Utilise your client-side exploitation skills to take control of a web app.
This challenge will test client-side exploitation skills, from inspecting Javascript to manipulating cookies to launching CSRF/XSS attacks. To start the VM, click the Start Machine button at the top right of the task.

You will find all the necessary tools to complete the challenge, like Nmap, PHP shells, and many more on the AttackBox. Also, please add the hostname worldwap.thm in the hosts file.

"Never click on links received from unknown sources. Can you capture the flags and get admin access to the web app?"
